## 🚀 How It Works

1. User enters the city name.
2. App fetches real-time weather data from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/).
3. It parses:
   - Temperature (°C)
   - Condition (Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, etc.)
4. Based on conditions, the app shows:
   - 👕 **What to wear**
   - 💬 **A motivational quote**
5. All results are beautifully displayed in a single unified GUI.
